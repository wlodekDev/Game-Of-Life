## Game of life
The "game" is a zero-player-game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves, or, for advanced "players", by creating patterns with particular properties.
In other words, every single cell on the board can have two states: alive or dead. This state depends on eight neighbor cells:
- every living cell with less than two living neighbors dies because of too little population
- every living cell with two or three living neighbors lives on
- każda żywa komórka z więcej niż trzema żywymi sąsiadami umiera z powodu przeludnienia
- every dead cell comes alive when it has exactly three living neighbors
